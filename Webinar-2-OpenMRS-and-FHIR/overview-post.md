## Learning Objectives

1. Quickly review the [First Webinar: An Introduction to the FHIR API](../Webinar-1-Intro-to-FHIR)
  
2. Get an introduction to the OpenMRS FHIR Module and the OpenMRS Rest API

3. Review possible future directions for FHIR and OpenMRS

4. Participate in compiling lists of ideas for each of these categories:
        - Previous FHIR-related efforts in the OpenMRS community
        - Current health data, web apis, and interoperability needs.
        - Questions, Potential Issues, Forcasted Barriers, and any other comments or concerns from community members regarding OpenMRS and FHIR


# Introduction

## Review of Webinar 1

The previous webinar can be found on the [github page](https://github.com/uw-fhir/OpenMRS-FHIR-Webinars/tree/master/Webinar-1-Intro-to-FHIR)

We had a few issues with recording the video, and unfortunately have no video of the tutorial section. However, I finally spliced the audio recording and the video together and uploaded it to YouTube. If you'd like to watch it, check it out here:

Also, if you'd like to get some other perspectives on FHIR, check out these two videos from a tutorial #[Viet Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vietnguyenmd/) gave at last year's [UW FHIR Workshop](https://uwfhir.org/tutorials/):

1. [Intro to FHIR](https://vimeo.com/296068669)
2. [ClinFHIR Tutorial](https://vimeo.com/296069454)

*Quick Discussion:* best approaches to tutorials and community education?

# Possible Paths Forward 
https://openmrs.slack.com/archives/CKLPH66BB/p1561654221061100

## Case Study: HAPI FHIR
A Java-based implementation of the FHIR standard whose development tracks very closely with the official releases.
