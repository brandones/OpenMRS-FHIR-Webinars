# An Introduction to the FHIR API

What is FHIR?

--> What is an API?

* Basically, if some app/service is though of as a covered box, with lots of different machinery --> hard to add anything / build anything to work with / figure out what the machine really does
* But if your machine provides some sort of interface: connector that has documentation for available functionality of the connector --> allows interoperability
* Ideally, you have a universal connector: for example, usbs in many hardware applications; used by most devices, allows for easier interoperability

APIs provide that sort of interface for services / apps / etc --> break down "official" definition

--> OpenMRS actually has an API --> quick overview of Restful Web Services

--> quickly highlight what the API might be lacking: 
- Not universal
- Lacking some documentation
- Lacking wider community use?


--> Go back to focus on FHIR:
scope is more general (Healthcare),
but:

Aim to provide a standard representation of healthcare records in all types of healthcare situations.

* In line with tech industry standards
* Buying from a wide range of stakeholders
* Adopted by HL7
* Bedrock for a number of related technologies

* Promissing!
